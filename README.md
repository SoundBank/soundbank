SoundBank
=========

A distributed portfolio library app aimed at the media industry.

  - Still in early development.

SoundBank is a scalable [Ruby on Rails] application using [Twitter Bootstrap] for cross browser and cross device deployment. 



Version
----

0.1 - The-Puckering-Browneye

Abstract
-----------

* To provide a centralised database of audio recordings for the media industry.
* To wrap in a responsive, scalable container for mobile access.
* To employ a secure and controlable membership system.
* Provide profiles and uploads for artists.
* Provide a secure purchasing system for clients.

Overall the application will have a strong Social Media feel, and be an enjoyable visual experience to use.

Shell Commands
--------------
```sh
$ rev README.rdoc

$ %blow
```
The above commands have nothing whatsoever to do with this application, but I felt inclined to provide some anyway.
