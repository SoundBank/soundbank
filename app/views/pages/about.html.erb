		We offer you a sweet profile with 50Mb of space to upload either full tracks or excerpts. That's quite a wodge of air-time if you're using FLAC or LAME encoding. You'll have access to stats and tools via your very own personal web panel.

		Once you've uploaded and presented your work it is immediately accessible to both other local artists, and more importantly to our consumer audience. If you sell one of your pieces then you have the option of using our professional re-mastering service. Or if you prefer, you can supply a finalised master of your own to the client. You are in control of your own music at all times.
